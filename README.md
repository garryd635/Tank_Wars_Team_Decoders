Project Details
=======================
A very early version of a Java game called Tank Wars; done during a Sophomore computer science seminar. The purpose of this project was to introduce the idea of working on a team using the basic foundation of the agile using Scrum Cycles and version control.  The project was also my first exposure to git.  The commits on this branch were demostrations to become farmiliarize with version control using git.  Due to the unfamilarity of both eclipse and eGit, commits on git had stopped early on the project.  Thus, this repository does not represent the final product.
